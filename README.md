Change Lync Conferencing Dial-In Number Display Order (GUI)
===========================================================

            

If you ever have more than a few Lync dial-in conferencing numbers but the order is off, you know it can be a pain to rearrange them.  That's the whole purpose of this GUI.  It's a simple PowerShell script that can be run from your Lync server
 or anywhere the Lync Management Shell is installed.  No parameters to specify, just pick your region in the dropdown box and move your numbers up, down, to the top, and to the bottom.


I have noticed that the change may take a few minutes to take effect and users may need to restart Outlook before the change is seen.  This is a function of Lync, not the script itself.


 If you like it, please give me 5 stars!  If you don't, please let me know why before rating (in the Q/A section, or find me on Twitter or LinkedIn via my TechNet profile).  I can make that bug fix for you, or possibly make the additon
 you're looking for depending on complexity. 


Before you run any script from the Internet, please back up your data as you agree to run this at your own risk!
